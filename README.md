# Node-Blog-Project
This is my first Node.js project. 

In this project, I used multiple npm packages such as Express, Morgan, Mongoose, ejs, etc. 
This project interacts with the MongoDB database. 

I used the concepts of MVC in this project, meaning 'Model', 'Views', and 'Controllers' to make my code more organized and easier to maintain.
